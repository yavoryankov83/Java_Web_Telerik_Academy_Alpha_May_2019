# HTML - in class task

Create the structure of a ToDo app.

1. Each todo has

    - ID
    - Name
    - Due date
    - IsDone

2. This app will be extended later on in the course with features, such as **add, remove and mark them as done/not done**. For now, make sure that there is a skeleton of the page to work with and a decent way of displaying all of the todo's information on the page.
