<h1>Stack</h1>

<b>A stack is a LIFO(last in first out) data structure</b>

<b>Real life stacks</b>

- A stack of dishes
- A pile of t-shirts(have you worn the bottom one in the last year?)


<b>Some practical use-cases of a stack:</b>

- The call stack - keeping track of currently active methods
- Reversing order
- Several important algorithms (like DFS)
- In editors where the word you wrote the latter is the first to evacuate when you utilize fix activity

<b>Common operations on a stack</b>

- push(elem) - adding an element to the stack
- pop() - removing an element from the stack
- peek() - "seeing" the first element, without modifing the stack
<br><br><br>
<h1>Queue</h1>

<b>A queue is a FIFO(first in first out) data structure</b>

<b>Some practical use-cases of a queue:</b>

- Print queues
- BFS
- Any circumstance where assets are shared among various clients and served on first start things out server premise
- Cases incorporate CPU planning, Disk Scheduling

<b>Common operations on a queue</b>

- enqueue(elem) - adding an element to the queue
- dequeue() - removing an element from the queue
- peek() - "seeing" the first element, without modifing the queue
