        // 3. Using the function from task 2, write code that will execute it with argument "1234567890"

        // 4. instead of executing lambdaSecondChar directly, suppose we want to pass it to a method. Write a method
        // called everySecondCharacter that accepts the function as a parameter and execute it with the argument "1234567890".
        // It should return the result of the function. For bonus points don't hardcode the argument string within the method.

        // 5. Using the new version of the method call it with argument "1234567890" and print the result

        // 6. Write a lambda expression that maps to the java.util.Supplier interface.
        // This lambda should return the string "I love Java" and assign it to a variable called iLoveJava
        // Use the supplier to get its result in supplierResult variable, then print it on the screen

        // Given a specific interface how can we tell whether we can map a lambda expression to it.

        // https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Callable.html

        // 9. Is the java.util.Comparator a functional interface?

        // 10. We have list with top female names for 2018.
        // Write code to print the items in the list in sorted order, and with the first letter in each upper-cased.
